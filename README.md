# hello-world

Hi! I am L. I am a newb programmer.

I know a little bit of Javascript, but I am now studying and practicing Python.

I am learning programming because I thought that I could do a lot of things with my knowledge in programming.

I think programming is anarchy. I could do whatever I want with the knowledge I would acquire.
