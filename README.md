# hello-world

Hi! I am Fer de Nanz. I am a newb programmer.

I am just starting to learn programming.

I am learning programming because I thought that I could do a lot of things with my knowledge in programming.

I think programming is anarchy. I could do whatever I want with the knowledge I would acquire.
